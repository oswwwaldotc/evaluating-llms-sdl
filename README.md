# Evaluating Large Language Models for Self-Directed Learning: A Framework for Optimized Educational Prompting Strategies  

# Introduction and Research Questions  
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in facilitating self-directed learning environments through structured prompting strategies. The research addresses two primary questions: 
1) Which LLM demonstrates superior accuracy and utility in generating educational content for self-study?
2) How can the implementation of automation methodologies be optimized to enhance learning outcomes?

# Background Research  
> Work in progress  

# Hypothesis  
It is hypothesized that LLMs employing iterative, role-based prompting strategies—augmented by human supervision—will produce more accurate and pedagogically coherent learning materials compared to single-step generation methods. Furthermore, models with larger parameter sizes and fine-tuning for instructional tasks are expected to outperform general-purpose counterparts.  

# Methodology  
A three-phase experimental framework was implemented:  
1. Role-Based Prompting: Initial prompts simulated instructional roles (e.g., "Act as a machine learning tutor") to generate structured topic outlines.
2. Iterative Content Expansion: Subsection generation followed a chain-of-thought approach, where outputs from preceding prompts informed subsequent queries (Wei et al., 2022).
3. Human-in-the-Loop Validation: Domain experts evaluated content accuracy, clarity, and pedagogical value, with feedback integrated into prompt refinements. 

# Analysis and Conclusions  
> Work in progress 

# Future Directions and Communication  
Future work will explore the development of autonomous AI agents to orchestrate multi-stage prompting workflows, reducing reliance on manual oversight.
